# Outreachy Documentation

This repository contains guides I created as part of my journey in open source and my preparation for Outreachy.  
It provides clear resources on essential tools like Git, Markdown, and Termux, reflecting my personal learning experience.

### Available Guides

An introduction to Git: basic commands, commits, branches, and best practices.  
*This is the guide I use regularly to practice and understand Git.*

**Markdown Guide**  
[Markdown-guide.md](Markdown-guide.md)  
A simple guide to learn Markdown and write readable README files or documentation on GitHub.  
*I wrote this guide to share what I’ve learned about clear documentation and project presentation.*
